I am pleased to present a project that I am implementing as part of a team project at Wroc≈Çaw University of Science and Technology. 
The project involves controlling the AlphaBot2 Pi robot with hand gestures. The robot is equipped with a Raspberry Pi 4. Gestures are captured using Computer Vision and the Processing with the use of Microsoft Kinect v2.

The repository does not contain the necessary Processing libraries. They need to be downloaded independently.
